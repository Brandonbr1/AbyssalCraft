<ul>
	<li>Changed the default values for a couple of config options (check the description of GitHub commit 69817fc for more info)</li>
	<li>Changed the internals of fuel handling for the Crystallizer and Transmutator (event runs before the defaults are applied, so you can override them)</li>
	<li>Added some ambient void particle rendering in Omothol and the Dark Realm</li>
	<li>Added a config option that toggles whether or not Evil Animals spawn Demon Animals on death</li>
	<li>Added a config option that toggles whether or not Evil Animals only spawn at night during a new moon</li>
	<li>Fixed the sky color in the Darklands biome</li>
	<li>Omothol Ghouls are actually immune to fire now (apparently they weren't, despite the book claiming they were)</li>
	<li>The PE Stream particle (the thing you see when PE is being transferred) now respects the particle settings (lower setting = fewer particles)</li>
	<li>Changed a plethora of Crystallizer recipes (added ore doubling, among others) and Transmutator recipes (reverting crystals is cost inefficient) along with removing crystals as fuels</li>
	<li>Added a config option (under modules) to revert back to the old recipes and behavior</li>
	<li>Crystal Clusters are now in the Ore Dictionary (as "crystalClusterX", where X is the element)</li>
	<li>Added Calcium, Beryllium and Beryl crystals to the Ore Dictionary</li>
	<li>Reworked the PE transfer logic in the statues to increase performance</li>
