<ul>
	<li>Added a config option to disable the plague Enchantments</li>
	<li>The Ritual Altar and Sacrificial Altar now adds the Glowing Potion Effect to its target (instead of making it emit smoke)</li>
	<li>Place of Power previews now show a tooltip with the blocks used to build it when hovered over</li>
	<li>All Shadow mobs now become completely invisible when it's dark enough (instead of barely visible). Bring torches with you to the Dark Realm!</li>
	<li>You can no longer brew Potions of Annihilation (considering how powerful the Potion Effect is, being able to brew it was just broken OP)</li>
	<li>Made the usability check in the crystal bag inventory more strict (fixes a dupe bug)</li>
	<li>Added a ritual (named Mass Enchantment) that combines the Enchantments of 8 Enchanted Books, then applies them on whatever is on the altar</li>
</ul>
