<ul>
	<li>Fixed a rendering-related crash with the various fire blocks added in the mod</li>

	<li>Tied some loose ends triggering log errors when some modules are disabled</li>
	<li>Added a config option to toggle whether or not Anti-Players can pick up loot (you really should just blacklist them in the mob spawner/duplicator instead)</li>
	<li>You can now open Necronomicons and Crystal Bags in the off hand</li>
	<li>Energy draining (through rituals and spells) now both take the off hand slot into account</li>
