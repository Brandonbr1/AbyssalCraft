	<li>Energy Container/Pedestal/Collector/Relay and Sacrificial Altars now behave as Items capable of holding PE in Item form (instead of only displaying the amount of energy contained)</li>
	<li>However, they don't transfer/receive PE externally, so rituals won't drain from them, nor will statues charge them while in your hand or on the ground</li>
	<li>The Dreadium Katana can now be enchanted properly on an enchanting table</li>
