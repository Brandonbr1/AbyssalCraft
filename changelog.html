<ul>
	<li>Capabilities (like Embers heat) will now persist with Upgrade Kit upgrading</li>
	<li>Improved the explosion code a bit more (should result in less freezing, also shorter completion time for the explosion)</li>
	<li>Large explosions no longer create particles (either the particles were oddly placed, or simply too many)</li>
</ul>
