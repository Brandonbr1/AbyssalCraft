<ul>
	<li>Capabilities (like Embers heat) will now persist with Upgrade Kit upgrading</li>
	<li>Improved the explosion code a fair bit</li>
	<li>Large explosions no longer create particles (either the particles were oddly placed, or simply too many, might replace with something else in the future)</li>
	<li>Added a config option for the size of an ODB explosion (also increased the default size)</li>
	<li>Added a config option for the size of antimatter explosions (also increased the default size)</li>
	<li>AbyssalCraft Explosions now deal more correct amounts of damage (the exposure property from the vanilla explosion damage code kinda nullified the damage)</li>
	<li>The particle display from the Ritual Pedestals can now be customized for each individual ritual through a set of predefined sequences</li>
	<li>Added a config option to toggle whether or not Upgrade Kits and the mechanic for them are added (courtesy of Mike-U5)</li>
	<li>The ritual chant is now played on the server side instead of the client (so you'll always hear a chant when performing rituals while playing on a server)</li>
	<li>Changed most of the ritual types to use the new particle displays</li>
