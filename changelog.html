<ul>
	<li>Lesser Shoggoths now ignore Zombie Villagers</li>
	<li>If any of the "Shoggoth Lair Generation Chance" options are set to 0, lairs won't generate in those areas, instead of causing a crash</li>
	<li>The textures for the Dark Offspring have been tweaked to look a bit more spooky and goatish</li>
	<li>Started preliminary work on optimizing worldgen features (trees, structures etc). Might not have a noticeable effect, but it's better than it was before</li>
	<li>Swapped the texts on the pages for the Decorative Shub-Niggurath and Yog-Sothoth Statues</li>
	<li>NecroData Chapter Page removal now reorders the remaining pages, instead of leaving blanks</li>
	<li>Added a method to Chapters allowing you to insert Pages (which doesn't override existing Pages, as the method for adding Pages does)</li>
	<li>Fuel registration for the Crystallizer and Transmutator are now handled through an event</li>
	<li>Dark Offsprings now only spawn during night, and their spawning is dependant on the moon phase (more common during a new moon, very rare during a full moon)</li>
	<li>Lowered the sound volume of the Dark Offspring</li>
	<li>Added a much needed information section to spells explaining how to inscribe them, cast them, and other useful information</li>
	<li>Added some new Place of Power structures</li>
