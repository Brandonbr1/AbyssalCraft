<ul>
	<li>Capabilities (like Embers heat) will now persist with Upgrade Kit upgrading</li>
	<li>Improved the explosion code a fair bit</li>
	<li>Large explosions no longer create particles (either the particles were oddly placed, or simply too many, might replace with something else in the future)</li>
	<li>Added a config option for the size of an ODB explosion (also increased the default size)</li>
	<li>Added a config option for the size of antimatter explosions (also increased the default size)</li>
	<li>AbyssalCraft Explosions now deal more correct amounts of damage (the exposure property from the vanilla explosion damage code kinda nullified the damage)</li>
</ul>
